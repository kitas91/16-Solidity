# 16-Solidity
Building a blockchain with Solidity

Background
Your company has decided to crowdsale their PupperCoin token in order to help fund the network development.
This network will be used to track the dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. You have already worked with the necessary legal bodies and have the green light on creating a crowdsale open to the public. However, you are required to enable refunds if the crowdsale is successful and the goal is met, and you are only allowed to raise a maximum of 300 Ether. The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.

This repository contains Solidity code for three smart contracts that handle compensation distribution in one of three ways:

Associate Profit Splitter:
The associate profit splitter divides the total compensation in equal parts and distributes to all associate employees equally.

Tiered Profit Splitter:
The tiered profit splitter divides the total compensation into three payments with different quantities depending on the tier of each employee.

This solidity code should be ran on the Kovan network.
